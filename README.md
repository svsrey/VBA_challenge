##Purpose of project

#The purpose of this project is to develop VBA code for Steve in order to analyze the market. We are particularly looking at the years of 2017 & 2018. 

#Results: The results can be found in the images provided on the GitHub page. The results show that 2017 was a good year for Steveâ€™s portfolio, whilst 2018 the market performed poorly the market. 

#Advantages & Disadvantages of refactoring code: The advantage of the code is it runs extremely fast allowing Steve to make quick trades to maximize his positions in the market. The disadvantage is that it cannot predetermine what the future of the market will look like, only the historical values. It his however, an excellent code to take a look at the overall performance within specific timeframes (historical values). This in turn will allow Steve to analyze and predetermine potential movements of stocks within a specific timeframe.
